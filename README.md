# Extended Movement Mod

This is a [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com) gamemode that adds a new way to move around: walljumping. With this new movement capability, players can move around the map in a way much more enjoyable than walking or running. On top of the ability to walljump, this gamemode adds a minigame lobby system where players can participate with other players in minigames like tag, hunted, deathmatch, and etc.

This gamemode is recommended to be played on dense city maps like [gm_bigcity](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=105982362). This gamemode will not work correctly on singleplayer mode, it should be hosted on a listen or dedicated server.

This is the official second version of Extended Movement Mod that has been entirely rebuilt to improve modularity and readability. This gamemode is a reiteration of the Garry's Mod parkour gamemode concept. The notable original iterations are [Blasphemouswebs's](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Blasphemouswebs) Parkour and [Mechanical Mind's](https://github.com/MechanicalMind) Team AWOL Parkour.
